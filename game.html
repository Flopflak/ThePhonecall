                <h2>Kraken Studios apologise for their last movie</h2>
                <p>
                    Kraken Studios posted an apology for their last movie which has been released last month. The movie was one of the worst rated movies
                    of the year, so far. And rightfuly so, general opinon was that the cast was terible, script as if it was written by an 8 year old and
                    camera work, just terible. Though it has also been stated that tomorow, we can expect another anoucment related to the AstroBattle franchise.

            <p>
                During ongoing world football championship, our team has once again disapointed. From the begining of the championship,
                they have only scored 2 goals. Our sports reporter interviewed one of the players, "Its sad. We had great ambitions this
                year around. Though we need more practice, I guess. It just feels like we aren't cooperating enough, like if everyone played
                solo."

                head of the state, many new features and improvement came with him. One of them is a newly written presidental handbook
                which should help new leader with any problems. This handbook was written with assistance of the former presidents. Its
                location is only known to the president and the minister of defense. Though it has been stated that it is avaiable to the
                president at all times and immidetly. For his safety, new bunker has been build, to which president also has access at all
                times and immidetly. To access it, a secret item is reqired. What this item is, is again only known to the president and the
                minister of defense. The equipment of the bunker is also secret, though it has been said that it contains backup phonelines 
                and everything else needed to handle an emergency...

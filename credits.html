        Easter egg / Fun fact! 100% of code in this game is either handwriten by me, or copied from some my
        older project. Why? As I am writing this, I am in Italy, and my apartment does not have internet.
        Tough now that I am thinking about it, I am sure that the older code is not 100% written by me.
        Welp...
